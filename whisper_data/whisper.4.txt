[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]    that we could build that set of data.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.560]    If that's of interest to folks.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.320]    I think that would be interesting.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.720]    I have a feeling that it's going up,
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.040]    but for reasons unrelated to the release game set
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:33.400]    for reasons ping.
